Steps to consider:


    * You need to create and set up your own AWS bedrock and IAM user with 'AdministratorAccess'
    * Go to models access, and select the model you want to access (Do not forget to request the access for the embeddings model of your choice too)
    * put inside the folder "Data" whatever documents you want to retrieve information from
    * Run from your vscode: streamlit run app.py
